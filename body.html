<div class='poem'><a>how sweet it is to be in the right amount of pieces for a collection of photos on instagram<br><br>

you puppy dog yawn, you wear pearl earrings,<br>
			you sing tween anthems, you replace yourself with cursive,<br>
			you eat all the sugar in your house,<br>
			you,<br>
			you,<br>
			you,</a></div>

<div class='poem2'><a>      later when you are called a snake dressed in girls clothing<br>
      remember<br>
      the one in your boyfriends bedroom<br>
      looked at you all glassy<br>
      as she<br>
      carefully undressed</a></div>



<div id='text5'><a>ugh everything is emberassing! sometimes the way u exist is emberassing!<br>
